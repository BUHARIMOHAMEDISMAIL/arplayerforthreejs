### A Pinch of Web Standard

- webrtc / getUserMedia - [spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/)
- WebGL - [spec](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/)
- Usual web - javascript/html/css etc...

---

### A Spoon of Open Source

- [three.js](http://threejs.org/) to ease webgl display
- [jsaruco](https://github.com/jcmellado/js-aruco) to find AR markers in video stream 

---

## All the ingredients seems to be there...

---

## Let's see how far can we go ?

### Display Webgl

- webgl is based on opengl ES 2.0
- Three.js javascript library from [mrdoob](https://twitter.com/mrdoob)
- Leading library to display webgl
- MIT license, so easy to integrate

---

### AR Marker Recognition

Several possibilities, we focused on

- jsaruco
- jsartoolkit

---

### js-aruco

---

### jsartoolkit

- what is it ? relation with artoolkit
- who did it 
- to use it in this in the pipe

# Markers

---

### Looks

- not too sexy
- but practical

---

## Markers Details

- each got a ID
- from 0 to 1023

## How to generate Marker

- you got a application in the repo
- how to use it

### Where to print it
- you can print it on paper
- you can simply display it on a
- May cause some reflect because phone screen are shiny
